# A well-commented example of a Discord Bot using Node- and Discord.js!
Python is sexy, trust me - but let's give JS a try!

This bot contains:
- A simple MySQL connection
- Configuration file (JSON)
- Common checks (Ignore DMs, Ignore Bots etc.) 
- Two basic commands (+ping, +about)
- SetStatus and SetActivity

As you can see, nothing special, just some common shit done in a fancy and good way.
